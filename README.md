# Mindfights

Mindfights is a platform for organising and playing mindfight games, otherwise called "quiz night games". It consists of 2 player types - the organizers and the players. The former are responsible for creating games, tours, questions, evaluating answers, making other organisers as collaborators to help evaluate answers. The latter are responsible for participating in those games, viewing results, history, other players and teams information.


The main goal of this project is to move mindfight games to virtual space, so it could be accessible from anywhere with any device, that has internet connection.


The need of this platform occurred when the synchronization problems accross multiple cities happened as teams wanted to participate to the same game but from the different location.


The system functionality is divided to 4 subsystems:
1. Administrator's subsystem - responsible for users and roles' creation, modification functionality.
2. Unregistered user's subsystem - responsible for allowing user to register to the system functionality.
3. Registered user's subsystem - responsible for user and team information and participation in games functionality.
4. Organizer's subsystem - responsible for games creation and answers evaluation functionality.
